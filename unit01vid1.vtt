00:00:04.751 --> 00:00:05.542\
Hello!\
\
00:00:05.542 --> 00:00:09.709\
Today's lesson is on the verb be in plural statements.\
\
00:00:10.542 --> 00:00:13.417\
Look at this photo of my friends Rachel and Jack.\
\
00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:14.999\
Guess.\
\
00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:16.334\
What do they do?\
\
00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:17.959\
Give up?\

00:00:18.709 --> 00:00:20.083\

My friends Lauren, Tara, and I are teachers.\
\
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.459\
We are teachers.\
\
00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:29.334\
All of you are students.\
\
00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:34.083\
My friends Rachel and Jack are doctors.\

00:00:36.584 --> 00:00:40.334\
We, you, and they are plural.\

For example: We are teachers.\
\
00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:46.125\

\
00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:49.959\
Notice the verb are.\
\
00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:55.292\

For example: We are teachers.\

These are affirmative statements, or true statements.\
\
00:01:13.918 --> 00:01:17.459\
We use negative statements to say something is not true.\
\
00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:20.834\
For negative statements, use not.\
\
00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:25.918\

There are two ways to make negative contractions with we, you, and they.\
\
00:01:42.626 --> 00:01:46.042\
